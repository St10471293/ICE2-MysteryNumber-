My Experience - 
My experience of setting up this code was substantial and easy to develop and was 
beneficial to make way as I am more familiar with visual studio code and the new way of 
how the work will be conducted. 


# Project analyses/details: 
My “Simple Components” Application.  is to display any inputs that you insert into it. 
# Features and Objectives of the App 
App Objective: 
The main Objective of this mobile app is to waas to learn and navigate visual studio 
code with the know how's of how to insert wording to receive an output. 
# Design Elements 
The design of the app was based on: 
1. User Experience: The mobile app is designed with the objective to provide an easy-to
navigate user interface, ensuring an unseamed user interaction. 
2. Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well in terms of device 
compatibility on different screen and or cellphone providers such as android and or 
apple. 
3. Simplicity: The design is modest, focusing on specific and straight to the point 
features without overwhelming the user. 
4. Performance: Code maximisation and optimization was bear in mind to Guarantee fast 
response times as well as low battery usage as not much coding is used that would 
result in drastic usage .


# GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 
This mobile application was managed using GitHub for version control, where majority 
code changes are pushed regularly. GitHub allowed me to keep track of possible 
changes as well as maintain project validity.

#Challenges and Learnings 
Throughout the course of the development of the app, I experienced a few challenges, 
being the following: 
First Challenge figuring out what logical errors could have been occurring in my code as 
my code did run at first but solved itself as i went through it. I also had an issue of 
figuring out how to push my code as well as readme. Solution – I communicated with 
my peers and student teachers and found a solution and pushed my contents.
